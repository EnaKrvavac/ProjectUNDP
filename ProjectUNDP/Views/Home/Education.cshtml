<p>UNDP places gender equality and the empowerment of women at the centre of its development approach. For this reason gender equality principles are at the core of the mandate of UNDP with being one of six signature solutions within current UNDPs Strategic Plan. Gender equality also represents an important accelerator for achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. At the UNDP Country Office level gender equality work is being guided by the Gender Equality Strategy (2021-2025) which provides a localised roadmap to reach the objectives of the corporate UNDP Gender Equality Strategy, and to operationalise the gender actions in the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (2021-2025) and Country Programme Document for BiH (2021-2025), and broader 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development:
<br>
<br>
 &#8226 Strengthened gender mainstreaming throughout programming, across 4 sectors: Energy and Environment, Regional and Rural Development, Justice and Human Security and &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Sustainable Growth.
<br>
&#8226 Strengthened resource mobilization and initiatives to specifically empower women
<br>
&#8226 Reliable data and evidence for gender responsive programming, contributing to new gender debates and knowledge production
<br>
&#8226 Partnerships to create a multiplier effect for gender equality
<br>
<br>
UNDP Country Office in Bosnia and Herzegovina has enrolled in the global UNDPs Gender Equality Seal (2021-2022) initiative that generates incentives for solid work on gender equality and helps to improve organizational efficiency to deliver results and greater consistency of performance.

Each Solution includes a mix of policy advice, technical assistance, finance, and programmes. Each solution has the potential to unlock the path to sustainable development. But no one solution will succeed on its own. We need all of them to achieve the SDGs.</p>
